            <p>For one year, I participated in a fellowship program and served as a green infrastructure technologies
              researcher for a low income Syracuse
              neighborhood called the Near Westside.
              The Near Westside had become a sort of test lab for student research and projects. At the time it was
              the
              third most impoverished census block in the country, and it was devoid of street trees due to a wind
              blast
              storm in 1998. Geography, architecture, and land use planning students surveyed the blocks and
              administered survey after survey. I even assisted with one such survey.
              Many of the participants struggled with the survey because of their
              English abilities. Many grew maiais just seeing the number of questions. Others imparted a strong apathy
              for “yet another survey”.

              <p>
                My frustrations with this survey (and others) grew out of the apparent lack of
                empathy for the participants’ economic condition, immediate needs and concerns, and language abilities.
                In tandem to this, I was working on my green infrastructure research and realized that I could not
                add to the residents' survey fatigue.

                The Near Westside Initiative non-profit organization has a strong relationship with a cohort of
                civically engaged residents. I reached out and coordinated
                with this organization to form a committee of resident representatives who could impart the values and
                preferences of the community, and co-design the project with me.

          <p>This information was pivotal in my research, as I was able to narrow my list of (scientifically) viable
            green infrastructure implementation projects to a shorter list that would meet the beautification and
            safety needs of the residents. From there, I collaborated with another non profit (Home Headquarters) to
            find a vacant parcels that did not have future viability for housing construction, and we built two pocket
            parks.

            <p>My understanding of the complexities of the Near Westside neighborhood would grow as my thesis advisor
              conducted research on their food security. I was loosely and tangentially involved with her project, but
              the learning lessons proved foundational
              to
              my current approach to qualitative research. <br> <br>

              In 2009, I took a GIS course and in one particular lesson, graduates in the department presented their
              GIS-focused capstone projects. I found one project fascinating - and so did the University. The woman
              used
              GIS to locate all grocery stores and all stores selling fresh produce. She found that there were zero
              such
              stores within the Near Westside Neighborhood, and created a map showcasing this, and wrote her paper and
              conclusions based on strictly quantitative methods. The neighborhood was henceforth referred to as a
              food
              desert.<br> <br>

              Jump ahead to 2012. I am working with my thesis advisor on formulating a thesis topic. She presents to
              me
              research that she is formulating, and invites me to work with her. Due to funding logistics, I was not
              able
              to work directly on this project, but I was able to stay current on the methods and results during our
              frequent check-ins on my thesis. Her project was in response to the aforementioned quantitative approach
              to
              understand the availability of fresh foods in the Near Westside. She took on a qualitative approach, and
              designed a survey to assess where and how the residents accessed grocery and fresh foods. The
              participants
              were recruited through phone screenings and were offered a $25 giftcard incentive for participating.<br>
              <br>

              Her conclusions painted a completely different picture from what the quantitative study originally
              derived.
              Although there are no stores in the neighborhood, there is strong social cohesion. And she found that as
              long as one resident had a car, all residents had access to a ride to the grocery store. And most were
              even
              shopping at the Wegmans in an affluent neighborhood about 20 minutes away. The biggest need, she found,
              was
              not access to the stores, but access to cooking classes, as many did not know what to do with the fresh
              produce that the had available to them! This connection between the quantitative study and the
              qualitative
              study resonated and influenced my community planning work in that I made an effort to always interview
              the
              residents, to paint as full a picture as possible. </p>
